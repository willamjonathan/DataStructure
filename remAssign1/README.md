Dear Mr. Tri,<br>

My name is William Jonathan Mulyadi, NIM : 2502045683, Class: L2CC.<br><br>

Thank you for giving me a chance to do a remedial for homework 1.<br>
The solution is in 2 cpp files, which are main.cpp (run here) and thegame.cpp .<br>
The .txt file contains the time complexity of the code and the explanations.<br><br>

Thank you, <br><br>
Regards,<br>
William Jonathan M.
