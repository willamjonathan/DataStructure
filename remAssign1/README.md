<h1><b>Dear Mr.Tri,<br></b></h1>

My name is <b>William Jonathan Mulyadi</b>, NIM : <b>2502045683</b>, Class: <b>L2CC</b>.<br><br>

Thank you for giving me a chance to do a remedial for homework 1.<br>
The solution is in 2 cpp files, which are <b>main.cpp (run here) and thegame.cpp</b> .<br>
The .txt file contains the <b>time complexity</b> of the code and the explanations.<br><br>

Thank you, <br><br>
Regards,<br>
William Jonathan M.
